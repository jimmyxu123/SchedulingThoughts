# Main Content
abstract: |
  Masked diffusion language models (MDMs) decode by iteratively unmasking tokens. 
  While the sequence of unmasking—the **"order of thought"**—crucially impacts 
  generation quality, it is usually determined by simple heuristics. 
  We introduce **Self-Aware Scheduling (SAS)**, a method that learns a lightweight 
  order policy using **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**. 

sections:
  - title: Key Contributions
    content: |
      * **Principled Policy Optimization:** We treat unmasking order as a reinforcement learning problem.
      * **SAS Framework:** Learns a lightweight policy for a frozen denoiser.
      * **Performance Gains:** Significant improvements in Sudoku accuracy (up to 97.5%) and mathematical reasoning on GSM8K (76%).
